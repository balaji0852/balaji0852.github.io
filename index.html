            <h2>2021</h2>
            </p>
            <p>During my college days, I have collaborated and built versatile sets of application for communities and
                academics. We built
                <a href="https://hye-secondary.z29.web.core.windows.net/" target="_blank">hiiii app </a>( A ride sharing
                platform,
                built for ride sharing, socializing, and organizing events) . We served a small number user base within
                our university,
                and due to zero rides situation, eventually we took it down to cut down costs. Now the hiiii app
                platform (flutter,
                Azure function-Python, MS SQL) is <a href="https://github.com/balaji0852" target="_blank">open
                    sourced</a> for public usage
            </p>
            <p>
                I had interned at FOLK-ISKCON for building ticketing application in flutter and firebase cloud firestore
                (NoSQL
                document database ).
                And that's how, I gained my flutter experience. </p>
